# Master's Thesis: Verification of the Flow Framework from "Local Reasoning for Global Graph Properties"

## Abstract

>  The Flow Framework [1,2] introduces a separation algebra that allows handling potentially unbounded
>  side-effects of modifications to global graph properties in a modular fashion.
>  In this thesis we formalize the Flow Framework as presented in "Local Reasoning for Global Graph Properties"
>  [1].
>  Subsequently, we demonstrate the application of the Flow Framework by verifying a graph algorithm.
>  Finally, we present a significantly refined proof for a central theorem of the framework.
